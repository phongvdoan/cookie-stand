      <p>Our store makes and sales cookies that mimic a taste of salmon. One night while vacationing near the Mississippi River, our family had an epiphany. Everyone loves cookies and most people like salmon, so why not put it together? Endlessly we researched if it has been done before and after a day of this tiresome task, it has not. This is a family buiness, which an uncle as a marketer. You can see our current sales around the world at <a href="sales.html">here</a></p>
